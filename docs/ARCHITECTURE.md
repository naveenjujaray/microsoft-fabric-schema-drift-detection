# Architecture

## Design goals

1. **One code path, two worlds.** The drift engine never knows whether schemas
   came from a live Fabric tenant or a local DuckDB file. `SchemaBackend` (ABC)
   is the seam; `FabricBackend` and `LocalBackend` are the implementations.
2. **Lineage-aware, not table-diffing.** A rename in Silver must name the Gold
   columns, DAX measures and PBIP reports it breaks. The lineage graph is the
   core data structure, not an afterthought.
3. **LLM optional.** Claude improves severity judgment, fix quality and PR
   prose — but `MockReasoner` keeps the pipeline fully functional (and testable,
   and demoable) without a key.
4. **No second auth stack.** One Azure AD app registration serves Fabric REST,
   Teams Graph and Outlook Graph via a single cached `ClientSecretCredential`
   (`src/azure_auth.py`).

## Data flow of one cycle (`main.run_once`)

1. Backend snapshots all available layers into `LayerSchema` dataclasses.
2. `SchemaStore` loads the baseline snapshots (first run captures them instead).
3. `schema_diff.diff_all` produces per-layer `DriftRecord`s:
   - drop+add pairs are re-classified as **renames** when base type matches and
     ordinal position or name similarity (difflib ≥ 0.55) agrees;
   - type changes are **warning** when the cast is widening/safe
     (`INTEGER→BIGINT`), **critical** otherwise (`DECIMAL→VARCHAR`).
4. `medallion.build_lineage_graph` assembles edges:
   - Bronze→Silver→Gold from the declared mappings;
   - Gold→model columns from each model table's `sourceTable`;
   - model columns→measures by regex-parsing `Table[Column]` refs out of DAX;
   - model columns/measures→report bindings from PBIP metadata.
5. `lineage.annotate_downstream` BFS-walks each breaking drift, fills
   `downstream_impact`, and synthesizes `cross_layer_break` records for
   impacted nodes in *other* layers (deduped).
6. `llm_reasoner` (Claude or mock): impact JSON → severity adjustments,
   fix suggestions (exact TMDL find/replace), PR title/body/commit message.
7. `git_handler` branches (`drift-fix/<timestamp>`), applies fixes under the
   configured PBIP folder, commits, pushes, opens the PR (gh CLI → REST
   fallback). Never touches the base branch. Dry-run prints instead.
8. `notifications.dispatcher` renders the single `DriftAlert` per channel and
   sends; failures are isolated and reported per channel.

Exit code is 1 when critical drifts exist — usable as a CI gate.

## Key decisions

* **Rename detection is heuristic by design.** Same-type + same-position or
  similar-name covers the common "rename in a transform" case; ambiguous pairs
  fall back to drop+add (safe: more severe, never less).
* **The mapping tables in `medallion.py` are the transformation contract.**
  `build_medallion.py` generates its SQL *from the same names*, so the lineage
  graph can't drift from the transforms in simulate mode. In live mode the
  equivalent manifest should be exported from your Dataflow/pipeline repo.
* **Measures are graph nodes** (`layer:Table#Measure`), so measure breakage is
  first-class, and report bindings can hang off measures as well as columns.
* **Baselines are plain JSON** — diffable, reviewable, committable if you want
  schema history in Git.
